## Usage

Use the neighborhoods_coordinates.csv file for the latitude and longitudes of each neighborhood. The sfo_neighborhoods_census_data.csv holds all the real estate data including rent and sale prices to be used in the analysis. The code groups this data by year in order to create a time series of sale price per square foot, housing units sold, and gross rent.
